# Project Overview: Secure Algorithms and Protocols for Virtual Game Rooms and Digital Identity Management

This project focuses on designing and implementing critical security functionalities for a virtual game room platform. The goal is to ensure transparent and secure participation in online games, such as Bingo, by leveraging a continuous random string generation mechanism. Additionally, the project explores how to integrate a new, privacy-focused version of the Green Pass (GP 2.0), allowing players to authenticate securely without revealing unnecessary personal information.

## Key Objectives:
1. **Random String Generation for Fair Games**:  
   The system must allow all players to contribute to generating a continuous stream of random strings, ensuring that no single participant can influence or predict future game outcomes. This is crucial for maintaining fairness in games like Bingo, where results rely on random values.

2. **Green Pass 2.0**:  
   Players need to authenticate their eligibility to participate using an updated version of the Green Pass. GP 2.0 ensures that only necessary data (e.g., vaccination status) is shared, aligning with privacy regulations. The GP 2.0 also supports dynamic policies, adapting to new legal requirements over time.

3. **Security and Privacy**:  
   The system is designed with four pillars in mind:
   - **Confidentiality**: Sensitive data remains protected, even in the presence of potential attacks.
   - **Integrity**: The system continues to function correctly, ensuring reliable results in the face of malicious actions.
   - **Transparency**: The system is open to scrutiny, with security not relying on secret algorithms or excessively trusted third parties.
   - **Efficiency**: The solution is designed to be practical, ensuring low costs and minimal delays.

## System Features:
- **Multi-Participant Random Generation**:  
  Players and the server collaboratively generate random strings used for game results, preventing any single player from gaining an unfair advantage.

- **Green Pass-Based Identification**:  
  The GP 2.0 system allows players to access their game accounts and virtual funds securely while complying with privacy laws.

- **Dynamic Privacy Rules**:  
  The system can adapt to future changes in privacy requirements without requiring significant overhauls.

## Challenges and Considerations:
The project considers various threat models, including:
- **Collusion among players** to manipulate game outcomes.
- **Large-scale attacks** affecting multiple users at once.
- **Efficiency vs. security trade-offs**, ensuring the system remains usable while maintaining high security standards.

This project applies principles learned from security courses to build a robust system that balances privacy, transparency, and fairness in virtual gaming environments.
